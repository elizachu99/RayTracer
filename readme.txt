10 pts â€” soft shadow
* DISABLE OR ENABLE SOFT SHADOW PROPERTY by changing line 56,
  which defines a SHADOW_OFFSET. Comment out line 56 if you don't
  want soft shadows. The SHADOW_OFFSET is a float and defines 
  the distance between each duplicated light source. Recommended
  value 0.02 ~ 0.2
* Implemented soft shadow by simulating area light, changing each 
  light source from:
                                   +     +     +
                                     +   +   +  
                                       + + +    
          +             to         + + + + + + +
                                       + + +    
                                     +   +   +  
                                   +     +     +
* Each light's color intensity is attenuated by a factor of 25. 
* Still images are provided for both the hard shadow and soft 
  shadow renderings.
